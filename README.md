# Generation and Price Optimization of Fashion Content using DCGAN

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores the application of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) to automatically generate realistic fashion images and applies machine learning techniques to optimize pricing strategies based on visual content. By leveraging GANs and predictive modeling, we aim to support creative design workflows and dynamic pricing in the fashion industry.

## üìÇ Project Context

The fashion industry is undergoing a digital transformation, where artificial intelligence plays a key role in both creative and business decision-making. Designers and retailers often require large volumes of visual content and struggle with pricing optimization due to subjectivity and seasonal demand patterns.

Generative models like DCGANs can automate image generation based on learned distributions of existing designs, while predictive models can estimate product prices based on image features and metadata. This dual approach allows fashion brands to:

- Prototype new designs faster
- Visualize product lines
- Optimize pricing strategies using data-driven insights

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Fashion Content Generation**
   - Train a DCGAN on a curated dataset of fashion images, in this case, men's sneakers
   - Generate high-quality, diverse, and visually appealing fashion item images
   - Evaluate the realistic images using SSIM and Gini

2. **Price Prediction Model**
   - Convert images to tensors
   - Train regression models (Linear, XGBoost, Neural Nets) to predict prices from tensors
   - Optimize model performance using metrics like RMSE and R¬≤

3. **Integration**
   - Build a pipeline that connects image generation with pricing prediction
   - Allow for on-the-fly estimation of the optimal price for generated fashion items
